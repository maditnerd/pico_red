# piconode

A WIP of a lowcode web application (probably a bad but fun idea)       
The main goal is to but able to make fast web application based on data from multiples sources    
Node red dashboard is really limited and not multiusers

## Frontend use pico.css
- Easy to write and simple way to make HTML pages

## Backend made using node-red
- Node red manages data using a websocket
- Node red flows will manage authentification using a email-password/token system
- Basic role management
- Users are saved in global (don't intend to use this for a lot of users)
- Possible to make an application hosts on github.io which anyone can use as long as it has a nodered server
- Nextcloud documents can be used as a data source.
